# Homework 2
Group members: Jyothyraj Sobhana, Katarzyna Olszynska, Lucianna Tomlin-Paul, Mina Mahdi, Naomi McEntegart

Target audience: educational/professional 

## What are we building?
A productivity software to enhance an individual's productivity. It is a to-do-list/Habit tracker with a pomodoro timer that also implements a point/reward system for motivation purposes. 

## What does it do/What kind of problem does it solve
This software helps to keep you focused, organised, and helps you to build productive habits. Unlike many other to-do list apps available, this one will incorporate methods to encourage extrinsic motivation through earning points from completing tasks and buying rewards with these points. However, it will not promote toxic productivity, this will be minimised through enforcing breaks after pomodoro completion to encourage mental wellbeing.

## What are the key features of the system?
### Basic Requirements (to be coded using tkinter)
1. Create new list
2. View all lists
3. Display lists
4. Rename list
5. Delete list
6. User is able to add items to to-do list (input)
7. User is able to tick off items(Update the progress of task)

### Additional Features
1. Scheduling functionality e.g. deadlines and suggestion of target (to be completed) per day basis as a result on task creation
2. A session timer (pomodoro)
3. Program schedules reminders for regular breaks and task reminders whilst using pomodoro functionality
4. Categorising/colour coding of tasks
5. Points assigned for task completion 
6. Option to buy rewards for task completion with points - link to reward shop - API
7. It has 3 pre-defiened to-do-lists - daily, weekly, monthly 

## Provide a sample architecture diagram of the system




## Describe the team approach to the project work
Initially work together to code the basic requirements to ensure everyone has an understanding of how the to-do list will work by partaking in a group coding session over Zoom. The team will then adopt agile development style using jira to plan the subsequent tasks to be completed in mini-sprints until the deadline. We have created a github repo so that the work can be uploaded there and we can all see everyones progress. We intend to hold 15 minute Zoom meetings before each lesson a week to update each other, discuss the next stage of the project as well as regularly communicating on our slack group chat. We will also schedule longer-timed meetings when needed throughout the project. 
The additional features will be divided among the team as follows:

Jyothyraj Sobhana:

Katarzyna Olszynska: Will focus on colour coding for priorisation of the tasks- 3 levels of urgency.

Lucianna Tomlin-Paul: Will work in implementing the point and reward aspects of the app.

Mina Mahdi: Will work on creating the Habit tracker aspect of the app.

Naomi McEntegart:  Will work on scheduling / pomodoro

To test the code we will be doing a unit test whilst coding, then we will also do an integration test and finally we will be a system test as a whole to make sure that the system works seamlessly. We will also carry out a UAT(user acceptance testing) to make sure everything works the way that a user would want it to work refering to user stories to guide us in this process.
