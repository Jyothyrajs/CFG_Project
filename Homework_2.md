# Homework 2
Group members: Jyothyraj Sobhana, Katarzyna Olszynska, Lucianna Tomlin-Paul, Mina Mahdi, Naomi McEntegart

Target audience: educational/professional 

## What are we building?
A productivity software to enhance an individual's productivity. It is a to-do-list/Habit tracker with a pomodoro timer and also implements a point/reward system for motivation. 

## What does it do/What kind of problem does it solve
This software helps to keep you focused, organised, and helps you to build productive habits. Unlike many other to-do list apps available, this one will incorporate methods to encourage extrinsic motivation through earning points from completing tasks and buying rewards with these points. However, it will not promote toxic productivity, this will be minimised through enforcing breaks after pomodoro completion to encourage mental wellbeing.

## What are the key features of the system?
### Basic Requirements (to be coded using tkinter)
1. Create new list
2. View all lists
3. Display lists
4. Rename list
5. Delete list
6. User is able to add items to to-do list (input)
7. User is able to tick off items(Update the progress of task)

### Additional Features
1. Scheduling functionality e.g. deadlines and suggestion of target (to be completed) per day basis as a result on task creation
2. A session timer (pomodoro)
3. Program schedules reminders for regular breaks and task reminders whilst using pomodoro functionality
4. Categorising/colour coding of tasks
5. Points assigned for task completion 
6. Option to buy rewards for task completion with points - link to reward shop - API
7. Habit tracker  
8. It has 3 pre-defiened to-do-lists - daily, weekly, monthly 

## Provide a sample architecture diagram of the system




## Describe the team approach to the project work
Initially work together to code the basic requirments to ensure everyone has an understanding of how the to-do list will work. The team will then adopt agile development using jira to plan the subsequent tasks to be completed in mini-sprints until the deadline. The additional features will be divided among the team as follows:

Jyothyraj Sobhana:

Katarzyna Olszynska: 

Lucianna Tomlin-Paul: Will work in implementing the point and reward aspects of the app

Mina Mahdi: Habit tracker

Naomi McEntegart: No.3 - scheduling / pomodoro
